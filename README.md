# Image Classification with CNN and Transfer Learning
This repository contains a Python implementation of an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning with the ResNet-50 model.


## Overview

- **`/data`:** Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **`/models`:** Stores pre-trained models and checkpoints.
- **`/src`:** Source code for the CNN and Transfer Learning models, along with utility functions.
- **`/graph`:** Contains the Graph of Training Accuracy, Loss and AUC-ROC graphs

## Results

- The CNN model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set with a AUC score of 95%.
- Transfer Learning with ResNet-50 yielded an improved accuracy of 94% with a AUC score of 99%.
